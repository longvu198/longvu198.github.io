	<p>It is good to be an artist, to take from the imagination and make it appear on surface. When making art, one have to be a free thinker in order to create something from the mind.<br>
	<br>This is why I started to create my website, as a way to show my free thinking ability and my skill as a graphic designer. Also my appreciation for taking ART 74 in San Jose State University and using what I learns to create a website art.<br>
	<br>My Portfolio contains all the projects that I made in ART 74 and I want to share it to the world. One of the project that I did is making a collage while using the photographs I've taken on my trips to Singapore and Thailand. I used Photoshop to arrange the image, from selecting certain section of all my photographs and cutting them out and combine them into one image. The image you saw first on my Portfolio site is the collage I made using the skills I gained in ART 74.<br>
	<br>I also made a 3D model using Meshmixer and it represent the Vietnamese Zodiac of me, my father, and brother. Press on one of the links in the Portfolio and it will take you to the site where my 3D model is stored. And one of the links contained a Youtube video I made talking about the social life of people searching for parking. One last thing I should mention is that there is a net art I made in threejsplay.ground and you should see it for yourself. With the net art I learns about copying and pasting codes to create a repeating shape.<br>
	<br>The final project I made is using Processing to draw shapes and creating affects. And it did work pretty well as I made simple shapes that came with an affect as you can see in the bottom page of my Portfolio.<br>
	<br>All these projects that I did really help me to improve my skills on creating a website artwork. And allow me to be a free thinker when I am creating art.</p>
